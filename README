ilxr
========

A simple bash script to help install ilixi and its dependencies on your host machine.
Visit http://www.ilixi.org for more info.

ilxr only supports Makefile and autotools based packages for now. CMake support will be added soon.

Please submit bugs to <tarik@ilixi.org>.

How to add new packages
--------

ilxr includes example software stacks for single (slim) and multiple (multi) application use cases.
These are located in "./data/default/".

A package is defined using square brackets and can have the following key, value pairs:
* source - git repository, tarball
* autoconf - runs autoconfigure
* depends - list of dependencies which are installed using package manager.
* sudo_install - package is installed using sudo.
* pre_build - apply patches, create files, etc.
* options - specify configuration options, if any
* post_install - run helper script, e.g. install_modules.
* files - copy files
