ilxr v0.2

Support for cmake
- required for ilixi webkit and reflex support in ilixi
- parse configuration parameters just like autoconf based packages (Line 283)
- act on autoconf and cmake inside package_parser (Line 445)

ilxr should use a repo to download package recipes and accompanying files.
- Files in a repo reside in ./data/<repo_name>

	./data/default/webkit-dev	(multi app, including ilixi webkit, video/sound support)
	./data/default/kleistpark	(webkit-dev and lots of other stuff)
	./data/default/install_fusion.sh
	./data/default/.sawmanrc
	./data/default/.fusionsoundrc

Add support for files field to package_parser
- files=".directfbrc:~/ \ 
	 .sawmanrc:/etc \
	"
- <file_name>:<path> copies file to path

Warn user that sudo operation required in the beginning
