ilxr v0.2

Local archive/file support
- Extract local archive if source="file://ilixi.tar.gz"
- Apply local patch if source="file://001.patch"
- Search for file in ./dl/<package>

Create files in an organised manner using package fields, e.g. directfbrc or udev rules.
- files=".directfbrc:~/ \
	 .sawmanrc:~/ \
	 40-fusion.rules:/etc/udev/rules.d \
	 40-one.rules:/etc/udev/rules.d \
	"
